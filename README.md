# AI-Training
Learning AI to become DevOps With AI expertise. 



# 🚀 DevOps + AI Learning Path (for 4+ YOE DevOps Engineers)

---

## ✅ Phase 1: AI/ML Foundations (3-4 weeks)

### 🧠 Concepts to Learn:
- [X] What is AI / Machine Learning?
- [X] Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
- [X] What is a model, training, testing, inference?
- [X] Overfitting vs underfitting
- [ ] Basics of neural networks (optional for now)

### 🛠 Tools:
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Numpy, Pandas
- [ ] Scikit-learn

### 📚 Learning Resources:
- [ ] [Andrew Ng’s ML course (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
- [ ] [Google ML Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)
- [ ] [Kaggle Learn: Intro to ML](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)

## ✅ Phase 2: Deploying ML Models (2-3 weeks)

### 🔧 Learn:
- [ ] FastAPI / Flask for wrapping models in APIs
- [ ] Dockerizing ML apps
- [ ] Deploying to Kubernetes (Minikube / EKS)

### 🛠 Tools:
- [ ] FastAPI
- [ ] Docker
- [ ] Kubernetes (Minikube or cloud)
- [ ] GitHub Actions

### 🚀 Mini Project:
- [ ] Train a model (e.g., house price prediction)
- [ ] Wrap it in FastAPI
- [ ] Dockerize and deploy to K8s
- [ ] Trigger deploy via GitHub Actions

---

## ✅ Phase 3: MLOps (4-5 weeks)

### 🔄 Learn:
- [ ] ML pipeline lifecycle
- [ ] Data versioning
- [ ] Model tracking & experiment logging
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines for ML
- [ ] Model monitoring

### 🛠 Tools:
- [ ] DVC
- [ ] MLflow
- [ ] Apache Airflow or Prefect
- [ ] EvidentlyAI (model monitoring)
- [ ] Prometheus & Grafana

### 🚀 Project:
- [ ] Build a complete ML pipeline:
    - Train
    - Register model (MLflow)
    - Auto-deploy with CI/CD
    - Monitor accuracy

---

## ✅ Phase 4: AIOps — AI *for* DevOps (Ongoing)

### 🤖 Explore:
- [ ] Anomaly detection in logs/metrics
- [ ] Predictive autoscaling
- [ ] LLM-powered Slack bots for on-call support
- [ ] Auto cloud cost forecasting
- [ ] AI-generated tests / config / infra templates

### 🛠 Tools:
- [ ] OpenAI API (for LLM bots)
- [ ] Time-series models (e.g., Prophet, ARIMA)
- [ ] LSTM for resource usage prediction
- [ ] ChatGPT API + Langchain for building tools

---

## 🏁 Optional (but powerful): GenAI Track
- [ ] Understand LLMs, embeddings, vector databases
- [ ] Build internal AI assistants for DevOps tasks
